## Introduction

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. We've seen how to use Flask to
implement a web server with basic routing and views that handle user requests.

Flask has no database abstraction layer, form validation, authorization, or
other common web components that integrate pre-existing third-party libraries.
However, Flask supports extensions that can add these useful features to a web
server.

Recall that Object Relational Mapping (ORM) is a way for our Python programs to
manage database data by "mapping" database tables to classes and instances of
classes to rows in those tables. **SQLAlchemy** is an open-source SQL library
and object-relational mapper (ORM) for the Python programming language.
**Flask-SQLAlchemy** is a Flask extension that makes it easier to work with
SQLAlchemy.

A **schema migration** is performed whenever it is necessary to update or revert
the database schema to a newer or older version. **Alembic:** is a lightweight
database migration tool for SQLAlchemy. **Flask-Migrate** is a Flask extension
that handles database migrations using Alembic.

In this lesson, we will use Flask-SQLAlchemy to configure a database connection
and to define a model for storing data about pets. We will use Flask-Migrate to
perform an initial migration to create a database containing the pets table.

---

## Setup

This lesson is a code-along, so fork and clone the repo.

`Pipfile` has some new dependencies that we'll use in this
lesson:`flask-sqlalchemy`and`flask-migrate`. Run `pipenv install`to install the
dependencies and `pipenv shell` to enter your virtual environment before running
your code.

```console
$ pipenv install
$ pipenv shell
```

Let's use the `tree` command to view the directory structure. MacOS users can
install this with the command `brew install tree`. WSL and Linux users can run
`sudo apt-get install tree` to download it.

```console
$ tree
```

The `server` folder initially contains two files, `app.py` and `models.py`

```text
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
├── LICENSE.md
├── Pipfile
├── Pipfile.lock
├── README.md
└── server
    ├── app.py
    └── models.py
```

- `app.py` contains the code to configure and connect a web server to a
  database.
- `models.py` contains a **model** named `Pet`.

### Defining A Model

A **model class**, also referred to simply as a **model**, is a Python class
that (1) defines a new Python data type, and (2) defines database metadata to
describe an SQL table. We can treat a model class like any other Python class,
meaning we can create instances, invoke methods, etc. Additionally,
Flask-SQLAlchemy performs object-relational mapping between the model class and
an associated database table, while Flask-Migrate uses changes to the model
class to evolve a database schema.

Defining a model with Flask-SQLAlchemy requires a Python class with four key
traits:

- Inheritance from the `db.Model` class.
- A `__tablename__` class attribute.
- One or more class attributes assigned to the type `db.Column`.
- One class attribute specified to be the table's primary key.

Let's take a look at a model defined by the Python class `Pet` in
`server/models.py`:

```py
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from sqlalchemy import MetaData

# contains definitions of tables and associated schema constructs
# read more about Metadata using the link at the bottom of the page
metadata = MetaData()

# create the Flask SQLAlchemy extension
db = SQLAlchemy(metadata=metadata)

# define a model class by inheriting from db.Model.
class Pet(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'pets'

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String)
    species = db.Column(db.String)
```

- The `Pet` class is declared as a subclass of `db.Model`.
- The database table is named `pets`.
- The database table has 3 columns:
  - the `id` column is the primary key
  - the `name` column stores a string
  - the `species` column stores a string

### Configure the Flask-SQLAlchemy extension

The file `app.py`:

- Creates a Flask application object named `app`
- Configures the database connection to a local file `app.db`
- Creates an object named `migrate` to manage schema migrations (versions)
- Initializes the SQLAlchemy extension with the application

```py
# server/app.py

from flask import Flask
from flask_migrate import Migrate

from models import db

# create a Flask application object
app = Flask(__name__)

# configure a database connection to the local file app.db
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///app.db'

# disable modification tracking to use less memory
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False

# create a Migrate object to manage schema modifications
migrate = Migrate(app, db)

# initialize the Flask application to use the database
db.init_app(app)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5555, debug=True)

```

Eventually we will add routes to `app.py` to implement CRUD operations on the
`pets` table. First, we need to step through the process of creating the
database file `app.db` and adding the `pets` table to the database.

Let's configure the `FLASK_APP` and `FLASK_RUN_PORT` environment variables
before proceeding with the database migration:

```console
$ export FLASK_APP=app.py
$ export FLASK_RUN_PORT=5555
```

### Schema migration with Flask-Migrate

We know how to write SQL statements to define and modify a database schema. For
example, we used the SQL `create table` statement to define a database table,
and the `update table` statement to modify the structure of an existing table.

A migration is a set of SQL statements that tells a database how to move from an
old schema to a new one (schema migration), and also how to move a database
entirely from one server to the next (server migration). We will only be
focusing on the former, **schema migrations**.

A schema migration is also performed when we first define a schema, i.e. to
create the initial tables and other database structures. Thankfully, we can use
the Flask extension **Flask-Migrate** to automatically define the schema based
on models contained in `server/models.py`!

Change into the `server` directory:

```console
$ cd server
```

Type the following command to create a migration environment:

```console
$ flask db init
```

The `server` directory should now contain two new directories `instance` and
`migrations`:

```text
..
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
├── LICENSE.md
├── Pipfile
├── Pipfile.lock
├── README.md
├── notes
└── server
    ├── app.py
    ├── instance
    ├── migrations
    │   ├── README
    │   ├── alembic.ini
    │   ├── env.py
    │   ├── script.py.mako
    │   └── versions
    └── models.py
```

The `instance` folder will eventually hold the database file `app.db`.

The `migrations` folder contains a migration environment:

- `alembic.ini` defines environment configuration options.
- `env.py` defines and instantiates a SQLAlchemy engine, connects to that
  engine, starts a transaction, and calls the migration engine.
- `script.py.mako` is a template that is used when creating a migration- it
  defines the basic structure of a migration.
- `versions` is a directory to hold migration scripts.

Next we will use the command `flask db migrate -m message` to generate a
migration script in the `migrations/versions` directory. The `-m message` is an
optional flag that lets us add a message describing the migration.

Type the following command to generate an initial migration:

```console
$ flask db migrate -m "Initial migration."
```

. The command results in two new files:

- The database `app.db` is added to the `instance` directory.
- A Python migration script of the form `###_message.py` is added to the
  `migrations/versions` directory.
  - `###` is a random version number.
  - `message` is the text specified with the `-m` flag.

```text
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
├── LICENSE.md
├── Pipfile
├── Pipfile.lock
├── README.md
├── notes
└── server
    ├── app.py
    ├── instance
    │   └── app.db
    ├── migrations
    │   ├── README
    │   ├── alembic.ini
    │   ├── env.py
    │   ├── script.py.mako
    │   └── versions
    │       └── ###_message.py
    └── models.py
```

Open the migration script in the editor. You'll see it contains functions
`upgrade()` and `downgrade()` that create and drop the `pets` table. The
`upgrade()` function is generated using the schema details defined by the `Pet`
model class.

Finally, type the following to run the `upgrade()` function and create the
`pets` table:

```console
$ flask db upgrade head
```

The `head` is optional and refers to the most recent migration version.

Open the database file `app.db` using a VSCode extension for viewing SQLite
database. The image below shows the database using the `SQLite Viewer`
extension. Assuming you've installed the extension, right-click on `app.db`,
then select `Open With.../SQLite Viewer`. Confirm the database contains a new
table named `pets` with columns as defined by the `Pet` model class.

## Column Constraints

The `Pet` model maps to a basic database table with 3 columns (`id`, `name`,
`species`). There are no column constraints other than the primary key `id`:

```py
# define a model class by inheriting from db.Model.
class Pet(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'pets'

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String)
    species = db.Column(db.String)
```

However, SQLAlchemy (and therefore Flask-SQLAlchemy) let's us define many types
of column constraints. For example, the `User` model below demonstrates some
common constraints:

```py
class User(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'users'

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True,
                         nullable=False, index=True)
    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True)
    verified = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False)
```

- `id` is the primary key
- `username` is a unique string of length 80. Null values are not allowed. An
  index is set on the column to speed up queries when searched by this column.
- `email` is a unique string of length 120. Null values are allowed.
- `verified` is a boolean that defaults to `False` if a value is not given.

## Conclusion

**Flask-SQLAlchemy** is a Flask extension that simplifies the task of connecting
a Flask application with a database. Flask-SQLAlchemy also makes it easy to
define a database model.

**Flask-Migrate** is a Flask extension for performing schema migrations. We used
several Flask-Migrate commands to create the initial version of our database:

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Flask-Migrate Command</th>
  <th>What It Does</th>
  <th>Command Frequency</th>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>
  <code>flask db init</code>
  </td>
  <td>

  <td>
  Autogenerates a new migration script in the <code>migrations</code> folder.
  </td>
  <td>
  Run each time a model class is added/updated in <code>models.py</code>.
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>
  <code>flask db upgrade head</code>
